# NeuraBalancer: Technical Documentation

## **🔹 Overview**
The **AI-Driven Self-Optimizing Load Balancer** is a high-performance, **self-learning** traffic distribution system designed to optimize request routing based on **server health, request complexity, and AI-predicted response times**. Unlike traditional round-robin or least-connections load balancers, this system leverages **machine learning** to dynamically predict and adjust traffic distribution in real time.

## **✅ Key Features**
- **Smart Traffic Routing:** Routes requests based on real-time server health, request weight, and ML-predicted load.  
- **AI-Driven Load Balancing:** Uses an **ONNX-based reinforcement learning model** to distribute traffic dynamically.  
- **Automated Failover:** Detects failing servers and reroutes traffic before they crash.  
- **Metrics-Driven Decision Making:** Collects real-time **Prometheus-based** server metrics for performance tracking.  
- **Scalable & Resilient Architecture:** Designed with **Kubernetes, NGINX, TimescaleDB, and Echo (Go)** for optimal performance.  
- **Observability & Logging:** Uses **Grafana, Loki, and Jaeger** for deep monitoring, logging, and tracing.

   - Analyzes **historical traffic, server performance, and request weight**.  

5. **📊 Metrics Collector (Prometheus, TimescaleDB)**
   - Stores **server response times, error rates, request loads**, and more.  
   - Helps the **ML model improve accuracy over time**.  

6. **🖥 Backend Services**
   - Actual **API services and microservices** handling user requests.  
   - Includes databases and any **application logic**.  

7. **🔍 Observability Stack (Grafana, Loki, Jaeger)**
   - **Grafana**: Real-time visualization of system health.  
   - **Loki**: Centralized logging system.  
   - **Jaeger**: Distributed tracing to track request paths.

## **🧠 ML Model Architecture**

The machine learning component uses reinforcement learning to optimize load balancing decisions. The model is trained on historical data of server performance, request complexity, and response times.

### Training Process
1. **Data Collection**: Gathering metrics from real server operations
2. **Feature Engineering**: Processing server metrics, request patterns, and response times
3. **Model Training**: Using reinforcement learning to create a policy for optimal server selection
4. **Model Export**: Converting to ONNX format for performance and cross-platform compatibility

### Inference Process
1. **Feature Collection**: Gathering current server metrics
2. **Prediction**: Using the ONNX model to predict the best server for the current request
3. **Feedback Loop**: Collecting response times and updating server health metrics
4. **Continuous Learning**: Periodically retraining the model with new data

## **⚖️ Load Balancing Strategies**

The system supports multiple load balancing strategies:

### 1. Machine Learning (ML)
Uses an ONNX-based reinforcement learning model to predict the optimal server based on:
- Current server load
- Historical server performance
- Request complexity
- Server health metrics

### 2. Round Robin
Distributes requests evenly across all servers in sequence.

### 3. Weighted Round Robin
Distributes requests based on predefined server capacity weights.

### 4. Least Connections
Routes requests to the server with the fewest active connections.

### 5. Random
Randomly selects a server from the available pool.

## **📊 Metrics and Observability**

### Key Metrics Collected
- **Response Time**: Average, median, 95th percentile
- **Error Rate**: Percentage of failed requests
- **Request Rate**: Requests per second
- **CPU/Memory Usage**: Server resource utilization
- **Connection Count**: Active connections per server
- **Queue Length**: Pending requests

### Visualization
- **Grafana Dashboards**: Real-time metrics visualization
- **Loki**: Centralized log aggregation
- **Jaeger**: Distributed request tracing

## **🛡️ Security Considerations**

- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents DDoS attacks
- **Load Shedding**: Gracefully handles traffic spikes
- **Circuit Breaking**: Prevents cascading failures
- **TLS Encryption**: Secures traffic between components
- **Authentication**: Secures API endpoints
- **Authorization**: Controls access to admin functions

## **🚀 Performance Optimization**

- **Connection Pooling**: Optimizes database connections
